Fluxamasynth32 Notes

* Internal analog voltage reference is 1.1V (but may vary per chip). You can route the aref to a gpio pin for calibration. 
* You can also change the range of the the aref using the set Attenuation function:

  analogSetAttenuation(ADC_0db);     // AREF = 1.1V
  analogSetAttenuation(ADC_6db);     // AREF = about 1.9V
  analogSetAttenuation(ADC_11db); 
  
* Resolution can be 12 bits but that's very non-linear. 11 bits seems fine.

analogReadResolution(11);
